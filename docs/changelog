cpm (0.25beta) unstable; urgency=medium
  * Security
    + The result of the cleanenv() call was not used for further error
      processing. Now this will be done.
    + Fix the stdin/stdout/stderr sanity check at startup so /dev/null is
      no longer necessary
      (patch provided by Lubomir Rintel <lkundrak@v3.sk>)
  * Bugs
    + ncursesw now is preferred over ncurses so the special characters for
      boxes now work again. Thanks to Thomas E. Dickey for support.
    + Correctly destroy the window when CTRL+C is pressed
      (patch provided by Marek Mahut <mmahut@fedoraproject.org>)
    + Modified install part in the Makefile so it should now work with
      none-GNU install tools.
      (patch provided by June Tate-Gans <mondoshawan@users.sourceforge.net>)
    + Under certain circumstances guiDialogAddNode() did not show an empty
      inputbox but the currently selected node instead. Now the inputbox is
      always empty.
    + Fixed wrong names of parameters in configure. The displayed variables
      mostly had the -dir prefix, the configured switches were missing those
      prefixes.
    + Added a call to EarlyExitOf() to fix keyhandling problems in CDK5.
  * General
    + Added commandline switch --environment to list the environemt after
      cleanup. This is mostly for debugging.
    + Added commandline switch --debuglevel with a numeric value between
      0 (off) to 99 (maximum debug information). This is for development
      reasons and bug tracking issues only and must be enabled at
      compiletime using the CFLAG -DTRACE_DEBUG
    + Added NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS to the list of permitted environment variables
      which get passed into the applications environment
    + Added distclean make target.
      (patch provided by Thomas E. Dickey <dickey@his.com>)
    + Renamed all configure options which require a path argument to
      --xxx-dir, e.g. --with-curses to -with-curses-dir
    + Added configure options --with-curses, --with-ncurses, --with-ncursesw
      and --with-pdcurses to choose the used curses library
    + Fixed method to determine the number of elements in the CDK
      alphalist widget so it's compatible with CDK4 and CDK5.
    + Added a guessing method to configure to find the dictionaries for
      cracklib without any further commandline argument.
    + Added support for Solaris 10 (x86)

  * Note
    + This release was never published.
  * Security
    + In case the current locked memory limit is too low, cpm now tries to
      raise the limit to the maximum value.
      (by Kurt Neufeld <kneufeld@burgundywall.com>)
  * CLI
    + Fixed the wrapper script so it now can handle systemwide DatabaseFile
      definitions in resource files.
      (by Carl Cravens <ravenx99@users.sourceforge.net>.
  * General
    + Added support of a symlink named "cpmv" which automatically switches
      to read-only mode.
    + Fixed a bug in the key handling part where a key was double-encoded
      for a check, which caused keys containing umlauts or other special
      characters to cause problems.

 -- Harry Brueckner <harry_b@mm.st>  Tue, 21 May 2007 18:55:18 +0100

cpm (0.23beta) unstable; urgency=medium
  * Bugs
    + The check for the availability of a secure key failed if the used
      key had a comment.
  * GUI
    + The statusline now reflects the correct ESC command which now switches
      from 'Exit' to 'Back' on deeper levels.
    + Modified the CDK support so it now runs with the current version 5 of
      this library. It's still not usable because of some bugs in CDK.
  * General
    + Finally the Debian repository is signed. For this, some scripts were
      modified.
    + Added some more search patterns to the default rc-file.
    + Modified the default password alphabet for automatically created
      passwords.

cpm (0.22beta) unstable; urgency=medium
  * Bugs
    + Fixed bug #1457707 where a new comment caused a segmentation fault when
      the comment was left empty.
    + Fixed bug #1458208 where CTRL+E caused a weird string to show up at
      certain occasions. The list control was not checked correctly for the
      available number of entries.
  * GUI
    + Added a dialog to ask the user if the lockfile should be removed in case
      it exists on program startup.

  * Bugs
    + Fixed bug #1437432 which created a lockfile even if cpm was started
      with the --readonly option.
  * GUI
    + GPGME 1.1 is now supported and the binary directly encrypts the
      datafile for the same recipients as it was encrypted before; the
      wrapper script is no longer necessary.

 -- Harry Brueckner <harry_b@mm.st>  Fri, 24 Feb 2006 17:32:23 +0100

cpm (0.20beta) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bugs
    + Fixed bug #1370314 which didn't allow @ characters in strings during the
      security checks.
  * GUI
    + The configuration option 'TemplateLock' now can be used so it's no longer
      possible to extend the tree structure with unknwon nodes. If set to 'no'
      the behaviour is like it has been before.
    + If no encryption key has been specified, the user is now asked if he
      wants to quit without saving.
  * General
    + Fixed CLI search 3 check so the regex error message test is ignored;
      it's enough to verify that there is an error, not which error exactly
      since the message has been changed between versions
    + Fixed bug in the configure script which did not examine the cdk.h file
      properly and also added a check for the version of GPGME
    + Modified the apt repository on the server to be able to hold repositories
      for several Debian versions
    + Added Debian package for Debian Sarge.

    + Fixed wrong encoding of the user identity which was extracted from the
      GPG realm

      not get locked if not enough memory is available
  * General
    + Switched from CVS to darcs
    + Added UTF-8 encoding check during program startup

      it was expected
    + Datafiles with size 0 now create an error and no segmentation fault
  * General
    + Added check to the configure script so CDK versions >4.9.10 can no longer
      be used since these versions can not handle empty lists properly
    + The default gpg key is no longer used to sign the database files;
      instead all keys which are used for encryption and have the ability to
      be used for signing are used

cpm (0.17beta) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugs

      made unique and the entries are alphabetically sorted.
  * GUI
    + The GUI now compiles with later CDK versions as well (highest tested
      version is 5.0-20050424)
  * General
    + Added check for the 'max locked memory' setting in the security checks;
      the behaviour can be controlled by the configure option --with-memlock
    + Makefile cleanup to cleanup temorary files of the check process

 -- Harry Brueckner <harry_b@mm.st>  Sun, 28 Aug 2005 20:37:54 +0100

  * General
    + added a gettext check to verify if the locale for de_DE is installed;
      otherwise the gettext check would fail one step later

      in the editor
    + When a comment is empty, the node in the XML document is removed
    + The screen now gets properly refreshed when popup windows close
    + Special entity characters like & did not get encoded properly in the
      comment field
  * General
    + Added a xmllint call to the import process so the created XML code gets
      generally validated
    + Added configure option --without-crack-lib to not use the library; this
      way cpm can be compiled on sytems without that library
    + Added missing zlib dependency to the Debian package.
    + Moved the import tools to a new directory in /usr/share/cpm with the
      proper permissions

  * General
    + Added several security checks to prevent core dumps, swapping of the
      application's memory, ptracing and environment variable checks
    + Added zlib compression support so the XML data inside the encrypted file
      is compressed and 'known plaintext' attacks against the encrypted
      database are harder to mount
    + Added filelocking mechanism so multiple users can not overwrite each
      other's data (when more than one user opens a file, only the first one
      gets writepermissions)
    + Signal handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM remove the lockfile, if it exists
    + Added several more tests for the 'make check' run, to provide a more
      secure package creation process

    + Added backup files when data is saved; this feature can be configured by
      the resource directive 'CreateBackup'.
    + Added a general import interface so it should be easy to add new formats
    + Added a conversion tool for Password Safe
      (http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/)
    + Created files now get their permissions fixed right after they are
      created; this should be safer than after closing the file
    + File status are checked on filehandles where possible; this should make
      it harder to trick the code
  * GUI
    + Set the default colors to transparent so the GUI also looks nice on
      transparent terminals

 -- Harry Brueckner <harry_b@mm.st>  Fri, 13 May 2005 19:47:21 +0100

cpm (0.7beta) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugs
    + The source did not compile on Gentoo Linux. configure failed on the
      library checks due to the wrong order of the library checks. This issue

  * Migration of PMS
    + Added a little script to migrate from PMS
    + Dennis Pries <eisbaer82@users.sourceforge.net> agreed that I take
      over his project PMS (hosted at
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/passwordms/) since he no longer has
      the time to maintain it.
      We both agreed that CPM will be the official followup of PMS.
