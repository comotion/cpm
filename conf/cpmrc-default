# this only works if you use one of your own private keys for signing; as soon

# define the default compression level of the XML data in the encrypted file;
# 0 - no compression
# 1 - best speed
# ...
# 9 - best compression
# WARNING: turning compression off reduces the quality of the encryption since
#          much more text is known in the encrypted file;
#          a 'known plaintext attack' might be more successful if no
#          compression is used!
Compression 9
